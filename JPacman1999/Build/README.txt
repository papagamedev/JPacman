JPACMAN

JPacman is a classic _Pac-man_ clone that runs on PC with Windows. It's a personal project I coded in 1998-1999 as a gift to my mom, a super fan of the original Pacman game.
It has the same Pacman game mechanics, but I added a couple of nice extra features. 
In late 2015 I found the original code in an old backup disc and I decided to revive the project and, eventually, port it to other platforms. Just for fun.
The original name of the game comes from my name (Juan Pablo) and Pacman: _JP_ + _Pacman_ = _JPacman_
